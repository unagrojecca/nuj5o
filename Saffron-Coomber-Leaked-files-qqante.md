Saffron Coomber's music and message resonate with young audiences who find solace and strength in her vulnerability. She actively engages with her fans online, fostering a supportive and inclusive community. Her advocacy for mental health awareness extends beyond her music, as she speaks out on the importance of seeking help and normalizing conversations about mental illness. Saffron Coomber has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
